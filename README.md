live-sdk
========

live-sdk is simple distro build system aimed at creating liveCDs

## Requirements

live-sdk is designed to be used interactively from a terminal.
It requires the following packages to be installed in addition to the
[dependencies required for libdevuansdk](https://github.com/dyne/libdevuansdk/blob/master/README.md#requirements).

zsh cgpt xz-utils gzip gnupg2 schroot debootstrap makedev curl rsync dpkg-dev squashfs-tools \
gcc-arm-none-eabi parted kpartx qemu-user-static sudo debmirror reprepro wget \
build-essential xorriso liblz4-1 rpl dialog sed cpio


`sudo` permissions are required for the user that is running the build.

Find documentation inside the docs directory of libdevuansdk. The 
following packages need to be installed to compile the documentation:

python-markdown ruby-ronn


### Devuan

```
xorriso squashfs-tools live-boot syslinux-common
```

### Gentoo

```
dev-libs/libisoburn sys-fs/squashfs-tools sys-boot/syslinux
```

## Initial setup

After cloning the live-sdk git repository, enter it and issue:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Updating

To update live-sdk, go to the root dir of the git repo and issue:

```
git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Quick start

Edit the `config` file to match your needs. Sensible defaults are
already there. Then run zsh. To avoid issues, it's best to start a
vanilla version, without preloaded config files so it doesn't cause
issues with libdevuansdk/live-sdk functions.

```
; zsh -f -c 'source sdk'
```

Now is the time you choose the OS, architecture, and (optionally) a
blend you want to build the image for.

### Currently supported distros

* `devuan`

```
; load devuan amd64
```

Once initialized, you can run the helper command:

```
; build_iso_dist
```

The image will automatically be build for you. Once finished, you will be
able to find it in the `dist/` directory in live-sdk's root.

For more info, see the `doc/` directory.

## Acknowledgments

Devuan's SDK was originally conceived during a period of residency at the
Schumacher college in Dartington, UK. Greatly inspired by the laborious and
mindful atmosphere of its wonderful premises.
